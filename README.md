# us_data

This project is an attempt to collect demographic and economic data at various geographic levels from disparate sources in one place. The data should be searchable, sortable, filterable, composable, visualizable, and downloadable. I'll definitely be using Shiny; I might use React if I ever get around to learning it. I can't say if this will ever be done, but I'll consider it a success when my first instinct is to look for data here rather than Wikipedia or a government agency.
